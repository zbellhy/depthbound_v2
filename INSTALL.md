# INSTALL — Patch v0.5.0 (Stats & Slots + Mutations v1, scaffold only)

1) Unzip into the repo **root** (same level as `index.html`, `src/`, `.github/`).
2) In GitHub Desktop: commit `patch: v0.5.0 stats+slots+mutations (flags off)` → Push.
3) Actions → Smoke should stay **green** (no behavior changed).

**Nothing will change in-game yet.** This is intentional—wiring happens in a tiny follow-up patch so we can flip flags ON without risk.
